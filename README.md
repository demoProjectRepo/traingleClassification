# traingleClassification
Classify a triangle based on length of three sides
Input will be three integers

Output will be a string representing the class of a triangle
This programme is written to find the type of triangle in the the output
first declare three variables of integer type for three side of a triangle
taking an input from user for the sides by using scanner
To find the type of triangle if else conditions are used.
first condition shows that the sum of the two  sides of the triangle should be greater than the third side.
next condition shows if all the sides of a triangle are equal than it is called an equilateral triangle.
next ondition shows us that if any two sides are equal to each other than the triangle is called an isoceleus triangle.
next condition is that if above  conditions are not satisfy then output will be the scalene triangle means none of the sides are equal to each other.
