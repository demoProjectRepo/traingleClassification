# traingleClassification<<<<<<< HEAD
- Classify a triangle based on length of three sides. 
- Input will be three integers

- Output will be a string representing the class of a triangle
+ This programme is written to find the type of triangle in the the output
+ first declare three variables of integer type for three side of a triangle
+ taking an input from user for the sides by using scanner
+ To find the type of triangle if else conditions are used.
+ first condition shows that the sum of the two  sides of the triangle should be greater than the third side.
+ next condition shows if all the sides of a triangle are equal than it is called an equilateral triangle.
+ next ondition shows us that if any two sides are equal to each other than the triangle is called an isoceleus triangle.
+ next condition is that if above  conditions are not satisfy then output will be the scalene triangle means none of the sides are equal to each other.
